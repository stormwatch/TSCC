                        A hastily reconvened panel of Judges accepted the decision by four leading child psychiatrists that the boy's mind was seriously unbalanced and that his work was a product of an “extremely unwholesome attitude towards life, his God and Country”. Bostock was recommended for psychiatric treatment following examination “without delay”. The first prize will now be presented to runner up Mary Whiteyard (aged 12) for her essay on Christian ethics entitled, “He died to save the little Children”.

                            The literary Competition which was for children aged from 7 to 16 years of age, was sponsored by leading national newspaper and received thousands of entries from schools all over Britain. Mt Humphrey Martin, the headmaster of Moordale Primary School said Gerald, nicknamed “Little Milton” by his English master beacuse of his poetic ability, was mentally advanced for his age, although inclined on occasions to obscure to obscure and verbose assertions which led him to being somewhat unpopular with his schoolmates He went on to say that without doubt the child had great future academically and that his progress was unsurpased in the history of Moordale Primary. Gerald and his parents move to St. Cleve four years ago from Manchester when Mr. Bostock decided for health reasons to live away from the city. David Bostock now does occasional gardening work while his wife

                            Daphne is well known to the congregation of St. Cleve Parish Church for her activities in social work and her wonderful buffet luncheon at the fete last Saturday. Well done, Daphne! Mr. Bostock said this morning of “Little Milton's” disqualification, “We are heartbroken at the way the judges changed their minds, and the loss of the prize money and scholarship means we shall find difficulty in paying the instalments on Gerald's Encyclopædia Britannica. I shall have to do Dr. Munson's roses next week after all.” When he heard of the decision against him, Geral went to his room and locked the door, “Mrs. Bostock and I are sorely vexed at the way this has turned out”, said Mr. Bostock of No. 6 Pollit Close, St. Cleve.

                            Many local residents are also annoyed and hurt by the news and as some consolation to Gerald and his parents the St. Cleve Chronicle prints the full text of the disqualified poem this week on <a href="">page 7</a>.

                            Many of the viewers' complaints were centred around <q>Little Milton's</q> use of a four letter word during the interview which followed his reading. The producer of <q>Young Arts</q> Michael Fenwick said later, <q>We have come to expect that sort of language from adults on television this days, but to hear it from a child of eight is particularly depressing.

AIded by other scruffy members of the action group, Gross tied up the policeman and attempted to auction off the <q>work of art</q> to passers by.

                            Following the release of the policeman by a number of construction workers who were close at hand, the demonstration moved inside the Gallery where serveral works were damaged and obscene appendages were drawn on some fine old paintings of racehorses. The arrests took place following a scuffle involving the artists and a group of Womens Lib supporters from Burnley on a three-day outing. Several of the ladies were badly bruised and unfortunately their match with Chelsea FC tomorrow has had to be cancelled.

                                The accusation was outrageous, said her family doctor, and there was no question of Gerald Bostock being called upon for a medical test, since the girl was obviously lying to protect the real father, but in her state of anxiety showed no sign of changing her story.

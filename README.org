* The Deadline for the Headline is the Breadline
  Recreating the [[http://jethrotull.com/taab/][Thick as a Brick]] album cover as a web page shall be fun. The
  gatefold consisted of a twelve page spoof of a newspaper with an overtly
  complicated tabloid page layout and —what is more— being a mock of a parochial
  newspaper it contained deliberate errata, misprints, repetitions, and was
  overall, badly designed using e.g. six or seven different fonts just on the
  front page, underlined headlines, and complete disregard for consistency; not
  to talk about the actual content.

  The original text was written by Ian Anderson, Jeffrey Hammond, John Evan, and
  Roy Elridge from Chrysalis with additional collaboration from other Jethro
  Tull members. I don't intend to reproduce an exact copy but to try new
  concepts as I learn them. There will be also a =facsimile= branch in which
  I'll strive to obtain a verbatim copy if time allows it.

  This excercise in layout originated as part of [[https://github.com/btholt][Brian Holt]]'s excellent web
  development course at [[https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/][Frontend Masters]]. 
  
** Main changes
*** Section links
    I added a section links menu as per the excersice guidelines while trying to
    keep the printed-on-paper look at the same time.
*** Rearrange the Layout
    In accordance to the excercise guidelines, I use Flex. Grid will surely be
    implemented at some later point.
*** Minimize the Use of Fonts
    - Headlines :: use Roboto Condensed bold
    - The masthead :: is typeset with Old English Text MT and will fallback to Chomsky.
    - “& Linwell Advertiser” :: is typeset with Script MT. I am currently
         looking for a free substitute fallback font.
*** All headlines are capitalized
*** No rules
    Except for the double rule at the end of the masthead.
*** Style
    I removed full stops from acronyms. Eg. “U.F.O.” changes to ”UFO”.

* Sources
  I used to own the local (Argentinean) vinyl press which didn't include the
  newspaper but I've also got the 25th Anniversary Edition CD remaster wich
  features a scaled-down but nevertheless full reproduction of the original
  twelve page tabloid.
